  Since Sep 2016, I am a University Lecturer (equivalent to US Assistant
  Professor) in Machine Learning at the Department of Engineering in the
  University of Cambridge, UK. I was before a postdoctoral fellow in the Harvard
  Intelligent Probabilistic Systems group at the School of Engineering and
  Applied Sciencies of Harvard University, working with the group leader Prof.
  Ryan Adams. This position was funded through a post-doctoral fellowship given
  by the Rafael del Pino Foundation. Before that, I was a postdoctoral research
  associate in the Machine Learning Group at the Department of Engineering in
  the University of Cambridge (UK) from June 2011 to August 2014, working with
  Prof. Zoubin Ghahramani. During my first two years in Cambridge I worked in a
  collaboration project with the Indian multinational company Infosys
  Technologies. I also spent two weeks giving lectures on Bayesian Machine
  Learning at Charles University in Prague (Czech Republic). From December 2010
  to May 2011, I was a teaching assistant at the Computer Science Department in
  Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Spain), where I completed my Ph.D. and M.Phil.
  in Computer Science in December 2010 and June 2007, respectively. I also
  obtained a B.Sc. in Computer Science from this institution in June 2004, with
  a special prize to the best academic record on graduation. My research
  revolves around model based machine learning with a focus on probabilistic
  learning techniques and with a particular interest on Bayesian optimization,
  matrix factorization methods, copulas, Gaussian processes and sparse linear
  models. A general feature of my work is also an emphasis on fast methods for
  approximate Bayesian inference that scale to large datasets. The results of my
  research have been published at top machine learning journals (Journal of
  Machine Learning Research) and conferences (NIPS and ICML).
