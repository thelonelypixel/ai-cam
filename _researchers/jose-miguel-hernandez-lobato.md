biography: I am an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning at the Department of Engineering
  in the University of Cambridge, UK. I was before a postdoctoral fellow in the Harvard
  Intelligent Probabilistic Systems group at the School of Engineering and Applied
  Sciencies of Harvard University, working with the group leader Prof. Ryan Adams.
  This position was funded through a post-doctoral fellowship given by the Rafael
  del Pino Foundation. Before that, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the
  Machine Learning Group at the Department of Engineering in the University of Cambridge
  (UK) from June 2011 to August 2014, working with Prof. Zoubin Ghahramani. During
  my first two years in Cambridge I worked in a collaboration project with the Indian
  multinational company Infosys Technologies. I also spent two weeks giving lectures
  on Bayesian Machine Learning at Charles University in Prague (Czech Republic). From
  December 2010 to May 2011, I was a teaching assistant at the Computer Science Department
  in Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Spain), where I completed my Ph.D. and M.Phil.
  in Computer Science in December 2010 and June 2007, respectively. I also obtained
  a B.Sc. in Computer Science from this institution in June 2004, with a special prize
  to the best academic record on graduation. My research revolves around model based
  machine learning with a focus on probabilistic learning techniques and with a particular
  interest on Bayesian optimization, matrix factorization methods, copulas, Gaussian
  processes and sparse linear models. A general feature of my work is also an emphasis on
  fast methods for approximate Bayesian inference that scale to large datasets. The
  results of my research have been published at top machine learning journals (Journal
  of Machine Learning Research) and conferences (NIPS and ICML).
