biography: 'Chris studied Natural Sciences at Christ’s and went on to complete a PhD
  at the Cavendish Laboratory. He joined the University of St Andrews as Reader in
  2006, and University College London as Professor in 2009. In 2015 he returned to
  Cambridge as the Sir Alan Cottrell Professor of Materials Science and established
  the Materials Theory Group in the Department of Materials Science & Metallurgy.


  Chris develops theoretical and computational approaches to the study of materials
  at the atomic scale. Starting from quantum mechanics, he writes computer codes to
  explore the structure and properties of these materials. Applications range from
  the design of better battery cathodes, pharmaceutical compounds, and high temperature
  superconductors to the depths of giant planets and other exotic dense matter.'
