biography: Maya Indira Ganesh is assistant teaching professor co-directing the MSt
  in AI Ethics & Society at the Institute for Continuing Education, and a Senior Researcher
  at LCFI at the University of Cambridge. Maya earned a Drphil in Cultural Studies
  from Leuphana University, Lueneburg, Germany. Her thesis was about the material,
  epistemic, and discursive infrastructures shaping the emergence of driverless cars
  as putatively  'ethical' and 'autonomous'. Her work is influenced by scholarship
  and practice in feminist approaches to technoscience, STS, Digital Anthropology,
  Media Studies, and Critical Data/Algorithm Studies. Her current research is about
  AI Ethics pedagogy in mediating the relationship between theory and practice. Between
  2008-2017, Maya was a researcher working with digital rights organisations at the
  intersection of gender justice and digital freedom of expression with human rights
  defenders, activists, and journalists across the majority world.
