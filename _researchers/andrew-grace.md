biography: Andrew Grace is Professor of Experimental Cardiology at the University
  of Cambridge. He trained in cardiology in London and Cambridge and then delivered
  a consistently high-volume interventional practice focused on arrhythmias over >30
  years. He completed post-doctoral studies as a Fulbright Scholar in the Department
  of Medicine, University of California, San Diego returning to Cambridge as British
  Heart Foundation Senior Research Fellow.  He is a recognized innovator having a
  particular interest in ‘disruptive’ technologies that have included devices, diagnostics
  and drugs. Some of his work has changed practice significantly and he made some
  of the ‘most important contributions’ to the development and implementation of subcutaneous
  defibrillators. His clinical research focus is currently on both activation mapping
  and risk prediction of ventricular fibrillation. He has spent over 25 years addressing
  the impact of genetic variation on the heartbeat and most recently has established
  a network of colleagues based respectively in Cambridge, Seattle, Sydney and San
  Diego to provide a physically robust model of cardiac electrical measurement extending
  from charge movements through structurally resolved sodium channels to surface recordings.
  Working with the Theory of Condensed Matter Physics Group (Cavendish Laboratory,
  Cambridge) and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute high-resolution charge density
  mapping of cardiac activation is being linked to multi-omics in single cells acquired
  through novel in vivo freeze-sampling; there is high anticipation of therapeutic
  target identification and rescue.
