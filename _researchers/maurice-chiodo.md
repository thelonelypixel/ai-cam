biography: I am a research associate in the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk
  at the University of Cambridge. I am the co-founder and principal investigator of
  the Ethics in Mathematics Project, where my work addresses the ethical challenges
  and risks posed by mathematics, mathematicians, and mathematically-powered technologies.
  My research looks at the ethical issues arising in all types of mathematical work,
  including AI, blockchain, finance, modelling, surveillance, cryptography, and statistics.
  I have been running a seminar series on ethics in mathematics for the past 7 years
  as part of the Cambridge University Ethics in Mathematics Society, and sat on the
  ethics advisory group of Machine Intelligence Garage UK for 3 years, working with
  over 25 AI startups in that time. I come from a background in research mathematics,
  holding two PhDs in mathematics from the University of Cambridge and the University
  of Melbourne on problems in algebra and computability theory. I have over 20 years
  experience studying, working, and teaching, in mathematics departments around the
  world.
