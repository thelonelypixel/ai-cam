biography: Alex is a Principal Investigator at the University of Cambridge, leading
  a research group aiming to understand the role that the hidden, uncultured microbiome
  plays in human health and disease. Throughout his research career he has specialized
  in the development and application of bioinformatics and genomic approaches to make
  biological discoveries with relevance to human health. After completing his PhD
  at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, he relocated to Cambridge as a Postdoctoral Fellow
  to expand his research to metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome. Using
  large-scale computational methods, his work led to the discovery of thousands of
  uncultivated bacterial species in the human gut microbiome, more than tripling the
  number of gut-associated species previously known. Now, as a PI his research focus
  is on characterizing the relevance of this huge novel microbial diversity for disease
  prediction, diagnostic and treatment.
