biography: Dr Boemo is interested in genomic instability, which is characterised by
  the rapid accumulation of mutations commonly observed in cancer cells. His particular
  focus lies in understanding how genomic instability is instigated by defective DNA
  replication and repair mechanisms. Having completed a BA in Mathematics at Rutgers
  University and a PhD in Physics at the University of Oxford, he addresses this complex
  issue through the lenses of mathematics and computer science by developing machine
  learning and high-performance simulation techniques to unravel the underlying causes
  of DNA replication and repair defects. This approach allows for exploring novel
  avenues for targeting these defects with therapeutic interventions, both in human
  cancer cells and pathogens. Currently, Dr Boemo holds the position of Assistant
  Professor of AI and Machine Learning in Disease, with a joint appointment in the
  Department of Pathology and the Department of Genetics.
