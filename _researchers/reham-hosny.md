Dr. Reham Hosny is a British Academy Visiting Fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, where she researches the intersection of AI, text and power. Her current interdisciplinary project aims to produce both academic outputs and tools for writers and artists working in and against authoritarian regimes. Dr. Hosny’s research background lies at the intersection of the fields of Cultural Studies, Media Studies, and Digital Humanities. Her work appears in peer-reviewed journals such as the Journal of Postcolonial Writing and Digital Culture & Society, and her forthcoming book @ArabicELit: Electronic Literature in the Arab World (2023, Bloomsbury) highlights new aesthetics and perspectives of the emergent field of electronic literature. She is an invited speaker at several international conferences and symposiums, and a member of various international research networks such as the Intersections, Feminism, Technology & Digital Humanities network (IFTe) funded by UKRI-AHRC and the Irish Research Council, and the Global AI Narrative (GAIN) network in the MENA region.  Dr. Hosny is an Assistant Professor at Minia University and previously was a Lecturer at the University of Leeds. She completed her joint-supervision Ph.D. in digital literary studies and critical theory between the Rochester Institute of Technology-New York and Minia University.  She is an award-winning digital creative writer and her co-authored novel, Al-Barrah [The Announcer] (2019, 2021), the first Arabic artificial intelligence novel, won the 2022 Robert Coover Award’s Honorable Mention. Dr. Hosny is the first Arab and African to be elected as a director at the international Electronic Literature Organization (ELO) and to be a convener of the ELO awards (2023).
