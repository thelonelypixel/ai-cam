biography: Haydn has been a Research Associate and Academic Project Manager at the
  University of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk for the past

  Singaporean governments; the EU, UN and OECD; and leading technology companies.
  He has over 40 publications with over 1,300 citations, including on climate change,
  pandemics, and societal collapse, but most of his work is on the security implications
