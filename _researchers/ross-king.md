biography: 'Dr. Ross D. King has joint positions at the University of Cambridge, and
  Chalmers Institute of Technology, Sweden, and he is a Fellow of the Alan Turing
  Institute, London. He is one of the most experienced machine learning researchers
  in Europe. His main research interest is the interface between computer science
  and science. He originated the idea of a ‘Robot Scientist’: integrating AI and laboratory
  robotics to physically implement closed-loop scientific discovery. His Robot Scientist
  ‘Adam’ was the first machine to autonomously discover scientific knowledge. His
  Robot Scientist ‘Eve’ is currently searching for drugs against neglected tropical
  diseases, and cancer. This research has been published in top scientific journals,
  Science, Nature, etc. and has received wide publicity. His other core research interest
  is DNA computing. He developed the first nondeterministic universal Turing machine,
  and is now working on ‘DNA supremacy’: a DNA computer that can solve larger NP complete
  problems that conventional or quantum computers. He is also very interested in applying
  AI and micro-robotics to double the number of known species.'
