  Aside from her clinical practice and university teaching roles, her research

  application of novel mathematical algorithms to digital images and to
  bioinformatic data. Her research team’s aim is to improve the objectivity of
  diagnosis and efficiency of workflow, ideally with full automation of many
  aspects of diagnostic histopathology. She has received the bulk of her funding
  from Coeliac UK, Innovate UK, the Pathological Society of Great Britain and
  Ireland, the MRC and CRUK and has applied for an NIHR Product Development
