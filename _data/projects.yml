    Connecting AI development to public value is more important than ever.
    AI@Cam will drive a new wave of challenge-led innovation, tackling the
    implementation gap between our aspirations for AI and our ability to deploy
    it to tackle major societal challenges. We want to generate new thinking
    about the role of AI in addressing major challenges, build coalitions in
    areas of need, and create partnerships to take research from lab to
    real-world benefit.


    An ambitious, multidisciplinary programme of challenge-led, AI-enabled innovation supported by AI@Cam will spin up new research teams, develop collaborations with business, policymakers and civil society, and take innovative ideas from the lab to application. Research teams supported by AI@Cam’s AI-deas scheme will have access to funding and research support to scale their work and impact.
