    Connecting AI development to public value is more important than ever.
    ai@cam will drive a new wave of challenge-led innovation, tackling the
    implementation gap between our aspirations for AI and our ability to deploy
    it to tackle major societal challenges. We want to generate new thinking
    about the role of AI in addressing major challenges, build coalitions in
    areas of need, and create partnerships to take research from lab to
    real-world benefit.


    An ambitious, multidisciplinary programme of challenge-led, AI-enabled innovation supported by ai@cam will spin up new research teams, develop collaborations with business, policymakers and civil society, and take innovative ideas from the lab to application. Research teams supported by AI@Cam’s AI-deas scheme will have access to funding and research support to scale their work and impact.

  faqs:
    - heading: What is ai@cam?
      content: ai@cam is the University of Cambridge’s new flagship mission to create
        AI technologies that serve science, citizens, and society. We’ll be
        launching a website in September with further information about our
        work, but in the meantime you can read the review that led to our
        creation here: <https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/aicam> Our plan is to
        develop a programme of activities that help address the issues set out
        in this review.
    - heading: Why have you launched this call? How does this connect to ai@cam?
      content: >-
        Amidst fevered conversations about progress in AI, the foundational work
        to connect technology development to public value is more important than
        ever. We face a cluster of complex challenges: recovering economic
        growth post-Covid; ensuring health and social care systems deliver for
        vulnerable people and patients; building resilience to the impacts of
        climate change; tackling pollution and biodiversity loss to enable
        environmental recovery; improving public service delivery in the context
        of strained resources; and more. Despite AI’s potential as a tool to
        help address these challenges, AI R&D is too often disconnected from
        public benefit.


        The University has an ambitious vision for AI that can deliver public benefit, which you can read in our [review](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/aicam). To deliver on this vision, we need a new infrastructure for interdisciplinary AI innovation.


        Challenge-led research initiatives can galvanise the research community in support of priority issues and help build capability in areas of need. Inspired by these approaches, ai@cam is launching a cross-institutional research initiative focused on how Cambridge can leverage AI to help tackle today’s major scientific and societal challenges. We want to generate new thinking about the role of AI in addressing major challenges, build coalitions in areas of need, and create partnerships to take research from lab to real-world benefit. Research teams supported by the scheme will have access to funding and research support to scale their work and impact. This challenge-led research funding scheme is our first initiative, and we’ll launch further activities during the autumn and winter.
    - heading: Who can apply?
      content: >-
        This call is open to staff at the University of Cambridge, working in
        any discipline, including natural, physical, biological, social,
        medical, and computer sciences, arts, humanities, and engineering. PhD
        students can also submit ideas, but please get permission from your
        supervisor first.


        At this stage, we’re looking for concept papers that set out an idea for challenge-led research that could deliver positive real-world outcomes through AI. You don’t need a fully developed research proposal to apply. For example, you might have the idea, but not yet have access to the tools or collaborators to develop and implement it. Alternatively, if you’d like to be involved in developing a challenge but don’t have a clear area of focus, check out the FAQ below about how you can get involved.
    - heading: Wait, what is this process?
      content: "Today, we’re launching the first of a two-step process. We’re inviting
        concept papers with ideas for research that can help deliver ai@cam’s
        mission. The second step of this process will build research teams in
        thematic areas, scoping ambitious challenge-led programmes on those
        areas. The reason for working in two phases like this is to encourage
        collaboration: we know there is interest in AI from across the
        University, and world-leading expertise across departments, but it isn’t
        always easy to find collaborators, and we hope to facilitate this
        process."
    - heading: I’m not a researcher at the University of Cambridge. Can I get involved?
      content: While this first stage of expressions of interest is focused on the
        research community within the University, we hope the resulting
        challenges will engage with external partners both in the UK and beyond.
        We’re particularly interested in engaging with communities affected by
        the development of AI and user groups with an interest in the design of
        AI systems. If you’re an external collaborator with an interest in
        ai@cam, you can sign up for updates about the
        mission [here](https://forms.gle/bAsKxnoY6E24DRTAA) or reach out to Jess
        Montgomery ([jkm40@cam.ac.uk](mailto:jkm40@cam.ac.uk)). Please bear with
        us while we’re in set-up phase; responses may take a little longer than
        usual.
    - heading: What support will ai@cam offer to these challenge-led programmes?
      content: After our roadmapping sessions, ai@cam will work with research teams to
        develop their idea into a challenge-led research initiative. We’ll start
        by providing start-up funding of up to £150k to help get the initiative
        off the ground. We expect this funding can be used flexibly, for example
        for research activities, equipment, staffing, teaching, or network
        building. We’ll host networking and engagement activities. We’ll provide
        support developing external connections and partnerships. We’ll also
        work with you on communications and profile-raising of the work. The
        exact package of support will be developed in collaboration with
        research teams as we develop the missions, and will flex over the two
        year period where we hope to help you launch your initiative.
    - heading: What will happen to my concept paper? And what commitment is needed
        from me at this stage?
      content: At this stage, researchers are submitting ideas via the concept papers,
        with the expectation of a time commitment for workshops later in the
        project development process. Concept papers will be reviewed by the
        ai@cam team and clustered into themes. We’ll then bring together
        researchers within a theme to scope a challenge-led programme. Depending
        on the volume of interest in this call, this would be through either one
        or several workshops in the autumn and winter.
    - heading: What kind of funding do you expect to offer?
      content: We anticipate offering start-up funds of £150k to selected challenges,
        working with those challenges to generate further income. Depending on
        the scale of demand, we may also launch a small-projects start-up scheme
        later this year. We’ll be using the concept paper and challenge scoping
        process to assess whether there is demand for this.
    - heading: What type of programmes do you expect to fund?
      content: ai@cam’s mission is to develop AI technologies that serve science,
        citizens, and society, and our focus is interdisciplinary research that
        addresses real-world challenges. We’re interested in projects that have
        a focus on public benefit, are trying to work across the pipeline from
        research to innovation and implementation, and that bring together
        expertise from across disciplines and user groups. Concept papers could
        relate to a new idea or build on an existing collaboration.
    - heading: What are the terms and conditions of funding?
      content: Funding will be deployable flexibly depending on the needs of the
        project. We will ask funding recipients to work with members of the
        ai@cam team to develop their projects, with a tailored support package.
        We anticipate working with challenges developed in this round for a
        two-year period, and for start-up funds to be deployed over this period.
        There may also be times over this period where we ask funding recipients
        to contribute to ai@cam events and comms activities.
    - heading: How can I apply?
      content: To submit a concept note, visit <https://forms.gle/e6jBHyUdbZ3wBV2f7>
