Giving evidence alongside Ian Hogarth (Frontier AI Taskforce), Dr Jean Innes (Alan Turing Institute and Ben Brooks (Stability AI), Professor Lawrence spoke about the opportunities provided by advances in AI and the policy frameworks needed to ensure responsible technology development. 

“We’ve got a real moment of steerage here. The two principle components of that steerage I see are whether these models are open or closed, and what business models drive the development of these systems,” says Professor Lawrence, “these are very complex problems. We need to be wary of simple answers or solutions, because we know they don’t work.”
